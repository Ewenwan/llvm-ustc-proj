# LLVM-USTC Practical Project

#### Introduction
This project provides practical framework on [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) and related compilation infrastructure as well as optional practical topics. The project is designed by the [s4plus] (https://s4plus.ustc.edu.cn/) research group led by  [Yu Zhang] (http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yuzhang/) in University of Science and Technology of China, which aims to guide more students and social personnel to learn and practice compiler-related knowledge, to carry out language design and implementation, program analysis, compilation optimization, etc.. Thus more and more people have the ability to use the programming language foundation to provide reliable and efficient Software solutions.
